## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML & CSS

I chose to the the contents page because I wanted to work on the with opacity, a background that covered whole screen and adjusted with size. I worked with lists and changing certain styles of text within the list. I also wanted to make a responsive.


## Lessons Learned:

I spent a lot of time learning how media query works I am happy with the end product because there were small details I had to work with to make the page look similar to the magazine.
